                    <p>Kalkyu!! is a group project made by 4th year Computer Science students of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Our mission is to make life easier with a little help from our product while making it universally accessible and useful.</p>
                    <p> We believe everybody has something to compute. Kalkyu!! unleashes the math in everyone â€” from gifted people to students finding out that computing is not really their thing. Anybody can calculate whatever they want, wherever they want.</p>
